v4.3.0

Released April 18, 2021

    new ♯940 : Improved support for touch devices.
    new ♯939 : Responsive web design for small screens.
    fixes ♯959 : Excluded '/api/Session::init' from CSRF protection (as per the API specs).
    fixes ♯959 : Fixes .lycheeignore support.
    new ♯942 : Add support for Portuguese language.
    fixes ♯927 : Also copy over the password column when migrating from the very old version 3 of Lychee
    fixes ♯932 : Public photos hidden

        It adds a new config variable public_photos_hidden, which defaults to 1 (preserving the current behavior). If set to 0, photos individually made public (rather than through an album) will be included in the results of a public search or in public tagged albums. Basically, they will no longer be treated as hidden (even though they still won't be findable through browsing; we could address that as well by making the Public smart album, well, public -- I welcome your input if we should, and if so, what to name the config variable to enabled that, other than public_public wink).
		
v4.0.8

Released Nov 19, 2020

    fixes ♯783 : Can't rename tag album

        Tag-albums were not accessible by albums.getByID

    fixes ♯781 : Fixes a bug which prevented the use of sharing albums between users

        This rare bug was only triggered if a non-admin user was sharing an album with another user.

    fixes ♯779 : Fixes some missing information on Tag Albums in the front end.
    fixes ♯766 : It is no longer possible to use the 'photo rotation' functionality

        While the buttons are still accessible we now return an error instead of filling up the entire disk space of the server.

    fixes ♯751 : In some rare instance, it was not possible to generate video thumbnails

        this is fixed. We try to reextract the 'aperture' property to get the thumbnail. We also added a warning in the case where FFmpeg was not enabled.

    fixes ♯769 : when moving pictures in Image view, the second try resulted in failure

        we no longer clear the content of json.album when moving an image. This ensure that the required properties are still accessible

    fixes : Settings are accessible in Image view

        There were rare sequence of events which prevented the settings view to open.

    new : /Frame will now display a warning if no pictures are found.

        instead of staying a black screen, we now send an alert()

    new : Share information are no longer displayed in public mode

        They are still available in the Ajax query

    upd ♯773 : Update French localization

        spacing typos in French localization

    new ♯771 : Update French localization

        minor changes in the French localization.

    new ♯764 : Add Diagnotics warnings if the php init values are too low (less than 30M).
    new ♯757 : Add limits on the number of logs seen.

        Too many logs lines where crashing php by using too much memory.

    new ♯758 : Add the possibility to chose the picture ordering per album

        the admin can now chose whether to order by name etc per album instead of globally.

v4.0.7

Released May 26, 2020

    new ♯588 : add an option to the sync command to 're-sync' images that already exist.

        Since XMP sidecars are now allowed, images with the same checksum will not get updated metadata if the sidecar changes but the checksum remains the same. This adds an optional flag to the lychee:sync command that forces existing images with no change in checksum to get updated metadata from XMP files (if they exist). It only updates the image if the metadata read in differs from the metadata that the image aleady has.

    new ♯599 : Added method to get the full path of albums.

        Specifically in the sharing screen, when albums are sometimes named the same (if they are organized by Year and Month), then it is impossible to tell which album you are actually sharing. This adds the ability to get the album's "full path" and sends it down for the sharing settings.

    fixes ♯596 : Failing xmp file read results in fallback to native exif extraction.

        If the EXIF succeeds but sidecar fails, it reverts falls into the catch.

    new ♯574 : Support of HEIC files and subsequently convert raw files (e.g. .NEF) into jpeg.

        if a raw file is imported such as .nef, php-imagick will try to generate a thumbnail jpeg for it. Note that the extension still needs to be added in your advanced settings.

        Important: Lychee was never meant to convert RAW files such as .nef, .cr2 .arw etc. If you shoot RAW, it is to be able to change exposure, dodge&burn, crop etc. later in a proper image processing software such as Lightroom, > Photoshop, Capture One, Luminar, Darktable … otherwise you better shoot JPEG. Lychee does not intend to provide those functionality.

    new ♯594 : Add debug bar for dev install.

        It is disabled by default, even in debug mode. To enable it, set DEBUGBAR_ENABLED to true in your .env file.

    new ♯579 : Ghostbuster command to clean up dead symlinks.

        The ghostbuster command also parses the database and see if some symlinks are dead. It will delete the photo from the database in such case. As this behaviour can modify the database, we disable it by default.

    new ♯577 : Parse additional xmp sidecars files to update metadata.

        This reads in XMP sidecar files (if they exist). Thankfully, exiftool supports reading in sidecars, so we can use the same technique we're using to read the files. We merge both file and sidecar metadata, taking priority based on user settings (default to prefer image metadata)

    fixes ♯581 : Undefined property errors when migrating from 3.1.6.

        The missing license, lens are now taken care off.

    fixes ♯565 : No Dropbox Import with Lychee 4.0.0.

        The CSP was a bit too tight, preventing the execution of the script from dropbox.
