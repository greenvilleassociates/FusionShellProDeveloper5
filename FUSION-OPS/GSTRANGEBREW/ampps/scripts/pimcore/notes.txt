1. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK : https://www.pimcore.org/docs/latest/Installation_and_Upgrade/System_Requirements.html
2. Install using composer and make zip, remove extra files eg.
	1.config/services.yaml
	2.config/local/database.yaml
	3.var/*
	4.public/bundles
	5.public/var
	
3. Follow installation steps mentioned in the link below, use the skeleton package to install via composer:
composer create-project pimcore/skeleton my-project
https://pimcore.com/docs/6.x/Development_Documentation/Getting_Started/Installation.html

4. Use utf8mb4_general_ci collate for database while manual installation otherwise command throws error.

5. Check "pimcore/pimcore" version in composer.json of "pimcore/skeleton" and download that version of "pimcore/pimcore" and check "lib/too/requirements.php"  if requirements verfication code is changed in "checkMysql" function then change requirements code accordingly.

6. Don't remove double quotes from "[[softdbpass]]" it throws error when contain "[" and "]".

7. Remove "DEFINER=`root`@`localhost`" From sql file.

8. Remove COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci From sql file if we have installed manually on Mysql 8. Because it gives error on installing with MariaDB. Besides this script itself doesn't use any collation and hence it takes server's default collation.
