1. We have added slims v8.1 as 8 since v8.1 is not mentioned anywhere in the package. It is mentioned only over site as 8.1.
2. Check how is the $sysconf['tg']['relative_url'] generated in sysconfig.inc.php
3. PHP REQUIREMENT LINK: https://slims.web.id/web/
We have set PHP requirement to 7.3 because it's manual installation does not start on PHP 7.0
(Works on PHP 7.2 as mentioned in requirement link(since 9.3.1), so we have made the same changes in info.xml as well).
4. Do not install with demo data.
