9. We have added "admin_email" in "oc_preferences" table since 16.0.4. ( In Forget password it asks for Email ID ).
10. Take database dump while First run wizard page is loaded(i.e before the dashboard page is loaded). Taking dump on dashboard page would add the entry '('[[admin_username]]', 'firstrunwizard', 'show', '0')' in oc_preferences table which would disable the run wizard.
