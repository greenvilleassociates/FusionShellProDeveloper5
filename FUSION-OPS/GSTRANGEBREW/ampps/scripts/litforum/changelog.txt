my little forum changelog

2.4.24 (2020-10-12)
-------------------
- fixed: broken layout of the links to the RSS-feed of a single thread in thread.inc.tpl and thread_linear.inc.tpl
- fixed: unintended text-transform: lowercase; for the link to top of the page in the options of an entry
- added: add classes for the user type to the thread tree below the entry in the single-entry-view

2.4.23 (2020-09-30)
-------------------
- fixed: wrong formatting of the link for a threads own RSS-feed, got broken by the work on formatting the RSS-links in the page footer

-------------------------
2.4.22 (2020-09-29)
-------------------
- fixed: broken backup restoring function for the entries table, rework of the backup function for better code readability
- fixed: corrected file size computation for the list of backup files; very small file sizes (up to a few hundred bytes) was shown as "0.00 MB" instead i.e. "0.0006 MB"
- fixed: remove of since PHP 7.2 deprecated function each(), replaced with foreach()

2.4.21 (2020-04-25)
-------------------
- fixed: regex for e-mail-validation followed a lazy syntax style, that invalidated with PRCE2. which was introduced with PHP 7.3; because of that one was unable to register a new account when running MLF 2.4.x under PHP 7.3 or newer
- fixed: image URLs in the RSS-feed was specified with only the local, relative path on the domain, we do need a complete URl with protocol, domain and path because the feed reader requests the feed from outside the domain

2.4.20 (2019-05-15)
-------------------
- fixed: call for a removed function in the JS-code
- fixed: inconsistend mail encoding, depended on an input string and could therefore result in wrong encoding, now fixed to the encoding, provided in the language file (normally UTF-8)
- fixed: missing CSRF-token in case of deleting postings
