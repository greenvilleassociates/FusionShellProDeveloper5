Details
-------

* Bugfix - Use trusted domains to compute the signature of signed urls: [#38465](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38465)

   All configured trusted domains are used when computing the signature of a signed url. The
   server has no real true understanding for which domain the request is sent. Especially in proxy
   scenarios this is a must have.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38465

* Bugfix - Handle exceptions with inaccesible federated share: [#38474](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38474)

   In a scenario federation share storage is inaccessible and returns connection timeouts,
   federated share storage now does not return not found but storage not available. Additionaly
   logging and notifications handling has been improved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4311
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38474

* Bugfix - Fix mispositioned ui elements after leaving viewerMode: [#38547](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38547)

   Until today, after leaving the viewer mode (e.G Pdf viewer) the action header table in the files
   list was mispositioned while checking an item. The download action and following items went
   out of sight.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38547
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38552

* Bugfix - Fix move operation from encrypted storage to unencrypted storage: [#38567](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38567)

   On a move operation from encrypted storage to unencrypted storage, the moved file was
   remaining encrypted. This problem has been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/encryption/issues/256
   https://github.com/owncloud/encryption/issues/257
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38567

* Bugfix - Creating self group-reshare should not not share to self: [#38581](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38581)

   In a scenario where resharing with group that user belongs to, permissions and attributes were
   incorrectly handled in share mount logic when permissions for that share got adjusted, or that
   share got again reshared to another user that again reshared with prior user. This bugfix
   prevents creation of self share mount in root folder of the user

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4382
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38581

* Bugfix - Check quota on the necessary move operations: [#38591](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38591)

   When encryption is active, a move operation between two different storages was leading to a
   broken copy on target storage if the target has not enough quota. This data loss problem has been
   resolved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38591

* Bugfix - Normalize web.baseUrl before using it: [#38600](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38600)

   `web.baseUrl` was used for rewriting private and public links to the new web UI without
   normalizing it. This leads to broken authentication if the `web.baseUrl` was configured with
   a trailing slash.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38600

* Bugfix - Don't rewrite private/public links when web app disabled: [#38602](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38602)

   When oc10 app is installed but disabled, we still showed the nav item and rewrote the URLs for
   private and public links.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38602
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38603

* Bugfix - When validating rereshare permission make sure to check parent mountpoint: [#4497](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4497)

   When receiving reshare for a group from parent folder and subfolder of that folder with lower
   permission, further reshares were subject to subfolder reshare permissions due to issue with
   resolving parent mountpoint. With this change we now ensure to take parent mountpoint out of
   received mountpoints

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4497
   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4382
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38625
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38651
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38862

* Bugfix - Objectids for comments and tags are strings: [#38682](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38682)

   We were using integers when asking for some information related to comments and tag. This was
   working fine, but PHP 7.4.18 made some changes in the postgresql driver making things more
   strict. As result, some queries were failing because that information was stored as string,
   not integer.

   This problem is now fixed, and the queries can run without problems.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38682

* Bugfix - Hide sensible information on share download: [#38689](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38689)

   Sensible information could be exposed when downloading a share via public link. We now throw a
   generic exception that overwrites the original exception message. Also fixed an error which
   caused such behavior when appending a null byte to the download URL.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4536
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38689

* Bugfix - Hide file drop content: [#38691](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38691)

   Requesting file drop share with the deprecated shareinfo API, exposed information about the
   content of the file drop share. We will now deliver empty content on the children entry.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4540
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38691

* Bugfix - Regenerate session after authenticate a password protected public share: [#38693](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38693)

   Session has been has not been regenerated after authenticate a password protected public
   share. Now we regenerate the session and delete the old one for anonymous users.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4535
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38693

* Bugfix - Add check when updating the permissions of a federated share: [#38698](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38698)

   This fixes a security issue where a federated share recipient could increase permissions on
   his share. We now limit the permission updates to federated re-shares only.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4537
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38698

* Bugfix - Prevent renaming or deleting a SMB mount point: [#38709](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38709)

   Renaming or deleting a SMB mount point will throw a 403 error code

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38709

* Bugfix - String to bool conversion in systemtags API: [#38719](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38719)

   String values like "true" and "false" were always converted to true when creating a tag via API.
   We now use filter_var() to fix this behavior.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38719

* Bugfix - Database query filter when getting a tag: [#38725](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38725)

   The filter values for userAssignable and userEditable were swapped, causing a wrong result in
   certain cases.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38725

* Bugfix - Fix federated share download bug happens on some providers: [#38738](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38738)

   Some WebDAV service providers are not able to respond properly when the HTTP client
   request_fulluri option set without proxy. Now, the HTTP client request_fulluri option set
   only if a proxy configured.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38738

* Bugfix - Correctly parse different ocm-provider api responses: [#38751](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38751)

   Some WebDAV service providers returns different responses for ocm-provider API and we were
   not able to parse these responses. This problem has been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38751

* Bugfix - Move files_antivirus executable mode config options into config.php: [#38753](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38753)

   Executable mode of the files_antivirus app is now configured in the core config.php file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38753
   https://github.com/owncloud/files_antivirus/pull/442

* Bugfix - Delay getting the file info until it's going to be used: [#38767](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38767)

   Some operations require getting the file info to perform the action. Previously, this file
   info was fetched and stored before any operation. In some cases fetching the file info
   triggered a file scan that could delay the whole request considerably.

   Now, we fetch the file info only in those operations that require it. There are some node
   operations such as getting the file path that don't require fetching the file info, so those
   operation won't fetch it, and so a potential file scan is prevented (for those operations)

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38767

* Bugfix - Expire shares at end of day: [#4324](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4324)

   The Expire Share background job was immediately expiring shares that had an expiration date of
   today. But those shares should continue to work for the rest of the day. The behaviour has been
   corrected. All shares will now work until the end of the day that they expire.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4324
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38775

* Bugfix - Image preview for file versions: [#38778](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38778)

   Changed the way how preview thumbnails are being rendered so they will be rendered properly for
   file versions.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38766
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38778

* Bugfix - Prevent files:checksum:verify from crashing on exception: [#38785](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38785)

   The command now skips files with exceptions instead of crashing. A proper message will be
   displayed to the user who fires the command.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38782
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38785
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/39005

* Bugfix - Include incoming and parent permissions in Share UI subfolder reshares: [#38788](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38788)

   Before this fix SharePanel in Share UI did not include permissions of both incoming and parent
   shares for subfolder reshares. It caused lack of possibility of resharing such files/folder
   even though server-side permissions allowed it.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4497
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38788

* Bugfix - Always allow renaming shared mounts: [#38794](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38794)

   We now skip the initial permission check when renaming a shared mount as this should always be
   possible.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4582
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/30325
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38794

* Bugfix - Adjust position of the share autocomplete element: [#38831](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38831)

   We now append the share autocomplete element to #shareTabView to prevent the autocomplete
   dialog from being hidden in certain scenarios. This happened with Safari for example as soon as
   the filelist was long enough to have a vertical scrollbar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4603
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38831

* Bugfix - Fix docs link to federated sharing docs: [#38859](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38859)

   The link in the share dialogue on the info icon was broken. Was fixed by pointing to the correct
   config value.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38859
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38860

* Bugfix - Fix file locks for public shares: [#38922](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38922)

   When using the new WebDAV API, the node which is used to retrieve file locks is either of type
   SharedFile or SharedFolder. Both these types do not implement our own node class, so we need to
   handle them separately. This is needed to properly handle file locks on public shares when
   using the new WebDAV API.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/36064
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38922

* Change - Bump doctrine/dbal from 2.10.4 to 2.13.1: [#38647](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38647)

   Implemented the new method executeStatement in our DB Connection class as Doctrine calls this
   method now instead of the deprecated executeUpdate.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38681
   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38647

* Change - Improve performance for the MOVE operation: [#38649](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38649)

   Previously, in order to move a folder, we needed to get all the content and replace the path of
   each one one by one. Now we replace the path of all the content in one DB query, which reduces the
   network traffic and allows better optimization in the DB. This change affects MySQL, MariaDB,
   Postgresql, and Oracle. Sqlite is excluded from this optimization and will use the previous
   behaviour.

* Change - Optimize share rename: [#38656](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38656)

   Renaming a received share could cause a file scan to be triggered. This could potentially be a
   performance problem if the file scan took a while.

   Now, renaming a received share won't trigger that file scan, so the performance will be faster.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38656

* Change - All mount configuration items marked as passwords will be encrypted: [#38728](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38728)

   Previously, only some known configuration items were encrypted. This was a problem for new
   items that required protection because this required changes in the core product.

   Now, all the items marked as passwords will be encrypted. This will be done automatically
   without 3rd party apps needing to do anything. A migration is also provided to update the items
   if needed.

* Change - Change favicon and color references to match the new CI: [#38750](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38750)

   We changed some color references to match the new CI-color of ownCloud. Also a new header image
   for the mail templates and the ownCloud logo without the "X" reference was added.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38750

* Change - Update PHP minimum version to 7.2.5: [#38934](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38934)

   The minimum supported PHP version is now 7.2.5. This supports some dependencies that require
   at least 7.2.5.

   PHP 7.2 security patches finished in December 2020. PHP 7.3 security patches finish on 6
   December 2021. It is recommended that you plan an upgrade to PHP 7.4 now.

* Enhancement - Improve public share federation user interface: [#4393](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4393)

   This adjustment provides a new way to add a public share to ownCloud. A new button will be
   displayed where you can easily add the share to the current server without entering the string,
   this requires less user input. Next to this button, a dropdown menu will be displayed, where you
   can see the current server or change the server. Hitting change a server will now display a
   prompt with a detailed explanation and more space to enter another server address.

* Enhancement - Automations in activity stream: [#38605](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38605)

   This adjustment provides a way to handle the activity stream for actions that were triggered by
   an automation (like the workflow app e.g.).

* Enhancement - Add html template for calens: [#38616](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38616)

   Added an html template to render the changelog also in html format. This will give us better
   control over the rendering on the website.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38616

* Enhancement - Expired shares in activity stream: [#38631](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38631)

   Add a proper message in the activity stream for shares which expired automatically. Previous
   to this, the expiry was authored by a user, which is technically not true.

* Enhancement - Use relative notification URLs: [#38639](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38639)

   Previous to this fix, absolute URLs were passed to the notification app. This could cause some
   CORS issues, hence we now use relative ones.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38639

* Enhancement - Add excludeActions parameter to registerDefaultActions function: [#38643](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38643)

   With this change we can pass now excludeActions to the registerDefaultActions function in
   fileactions.js, this allows us technically to omit specific file actions.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38643

* Enhancement - Improve tab headers UI: [#38653](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38653)

   With this change, tab headers will have a similar style to other nav elements, like the side nav.
   Also improved the UI on small display ratio, where elements in the second row were not properly
   left-aligned.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38653

* Enhancement - Add trashbin skip list to config: [#38704](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38704)

   With this change new config parameters has been introduced. Admins can now decide, based on
   file extensions, directory names and size, if a resource should not be observed by the trashbin
   and deleted immediately.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38960

* Enhancement - Remove google+ share button from personal settings: [#38705](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38705)

   Due to the google+ service has been declined, we won't show the google+ share button anymore.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38705

* Enhancement - Adjust the return type of the querybuilder's execute method: [#38714](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38714)

   The return type changed with the recent update of doctrine/dbal to version 2.13.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38714

* Enhancement - Communicate user profile picture capability: [#38722](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38722)

   A new capability "profile_picture" has been added so that clients can know whether to fetch and
   render avatar images of users.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38722

* Enhancement - Allow apps to implement their own license: [#38737](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38737)

   Apps can implement their own license parser by extending the \OCP\License\AbstractLicense
   class. Note that storing the license will still be performed by ownCloud. This custom license
   can provide additional information that can be queried through the ILicenseManager.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38737

* Enhancement - Command occ user:report shows additional row for guests: [#3467](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/3467)

   With this improvement, a new row will be rendered for guest user count on the occ user:report
   command.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38742

* Enhancement - Improve mobile user interface on files list: [#38748](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38748)

   This improvement solves the problem that files and folders with a longer name than 10 chars will
   cut off to 7 chars by hiding non-essential meta data. As well the uploading indicator text on a
   folders table row will now be displayed at the beginning to avoid UI glitches.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38748

* Enhancement - Resend invitation email: [#38774](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38774)

   Implemented an action to resend the invitation email for a user that has never been logged in
   yet.

* Enhancement - Add more properties to the REPORT result: [#38787](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38787)

   File Search should be done in the future via WebDAV REPORT requests. ownCloud web is using it. In
   some cases with other search backends we have more properties to return.
   `<oc:search-highlights />` => returns am html formatted excerpt of the file content which is
   highlighting the matching words. `<oc:search-score />` returns a float number score value.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38787

* Enhancement - Improve admin external storage settings UI: [#38795](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38795)

   Before this PR no error notification was shown while an external mount point configuration was
   not able to load. This was only indicated with a red square with a long list of external mount
   points, this was not handy. Therefore an error notification will be shown with the dedicated
   external mount point which fails to load.

   As well improved the add external mount point functionality with opening the available for
   select while adding an external mount point. The select will have now a 'select all' item. These
   changes prevents the admin to expose the mount point unwanted to all users immediately.

* Enhancement - Introduce new state to prevent scanning of shallow scanned folders: [#38804](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38804)

   Folders can be partially scanned, this means that a folder could have its closest contents
   scanned (the first level), but not deeper contents. Folder "/A" could be scanned but not
   "/A/B/C".

   Previously, we couldn't detect that a folder had been partially scanned, so we triggered
   another scan on that folder even though we already had data in the DB.

   Now, we can detect that the folder has been partially scanned to avoid another scan if it isn't
   needed. This leads to notable performance improvements in cases where a FS hasn't been scanned
   fully. Note that an initial scan is still required, and the performance will remain the same in
   this case.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38804

* Enhancement - Improve performance of the SMB log when it is inactive: [#38819](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38819)

   The SMB connector includes very verbose logs to trace what could have gone wrong. These logs are
   disabled by default, but although they're disabled we still need to check the state to decide
   whether we want to log or not.

   Now, the state check is faster and it takes less time to decide, so the overall performance of the
   connector is improved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38819

* Enhancement - Introduce the patch for CVE-2019-11358: [#38841](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38841)

   Patched jQuery's `$.extend` method. The code in core doesn't contain any vulnerable
   invocations of `$.extend` this is just a preventive patch.

* Enhancement - Introduce a remove license button in WebUI: [#38843](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38843)

   Before this PR, it was not possible, to remove any ownCloud license. This lead to an issue if
   someone enters an invalid license, a permanent message indicator was shown in the WebUI. With
   this PR it is possible to remove the license.

* Enhancement - Show notification if video playback is not possible on public share: [#4632](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4632)

   Before this PR no error notification was shown if a video can't be played due to browser
   incompatibility, for example, mov files on chrome.
   (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28746645)

   Now we will show a dedicated notification.

* Enhancement - Trigger file scan after accepting a federated share: [#38880](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38880)

   This is necessary as we need the fileId to pass it to the `remoteshare.accepted` event. The
   activity app can then hook onto this event and update the activity by setting the correct
   fileId.

   Also added a short translation for the SUBJECT_REMOTE_SHARE_RECEIVED activity.
