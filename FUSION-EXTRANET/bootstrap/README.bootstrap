This is a bootstrap program we used to replace index.html in the root directory.
The program identifies the current size of the window with the defaul being the base code and executes it.
If the system has 1400 or higher pixels, it increases the size of the working desktop.
On an Imac Pro the Desktop Resolution is above 2400 px so the change makes a fairly significant difference.
Framebase.html is the main program and loads at full size of the desktop... but it doesnt do a great job on mobile devices
which vary too much in their capabilities. As such we load a side window to control the actual desktop.
